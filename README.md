# Ranjith's DevOps Learning Journey

Live Portfolio: https://ranjith899098.github.io (working on making it live!)

## About This Repo
- Started as complete beginner with zero IT/coding experience.
- Day 1: Set up GitHub repo + basic README + GitHub Pages.
- Day 2: Added index.html homepage (copy-paste start → now editing myself).
- Day 3: Making personal changes + learning how auto-deploy works.
- Goal: Build 5+ real DevOps projects here to land a junior role in UK 2026.

## What I've Learned So Far
- GitHub commits trigger automatic CI/CD for Pages (green Actions!).
- index.html is the main page — better than just README.
- Small edits + commit = instant live updates.

More projects coming: Docker basics, simple CI pipeline, etc.
